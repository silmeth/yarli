## YARLI – Yet Another Rusty [Lox](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/wiki/Lox-implementations) Interpreter

My attempt at following the [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/)
by [Bob ‘munificent’ Nystrom](https://github.com/munificent) using Rust. Work in progress.

The code in this repository is under the [WTFPL](LICENSE), although it is based on (and as such
is mostly a direct translation of) the MIT-licensed Java code by munificent.
